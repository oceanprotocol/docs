### FIRST TIME CLAIMING?

You will need to wait at least one week, but not more than two weeks to claim your rewards for the first time. Check back on Thursday!

### FORGOT TO CLAIM?

If you forget to claim your OCEAN rewards, then do not worry because they continue to accumulate! You can claim them anytime after Thursday. 😃
