# veOCEAN and your APY

Rewards are earned by users that hold and use their veOCEAN to help the protocol improve and grow.  

To receive competitve short-term APYs, veOCEAN requires users to make long-term commitments.

First, make sure that you [understand the basics of APY](../df-veocean.md#veocean-and-your-apy) and how veOCEAN works.

Now that we got that out of the way, let's work through the examples and keep it as simple as possible.

### Estimating Passive APY

To make it easier to estimate your APY, [we have created a simple spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzuW5pBbX6j6hZL_XtJDtSR2-rDHa_LGOEwgoQ4D8lk/edit?usp=sharing) that let's you easily estimate your Passive APY.

We have provided 2 sheets as an example of locking-up 10,000 OCEAN for:
1. A 4-year investment period
2. A 6-mo investment period

The above are simplified examples meant for everyone to understand. They are naive investment strategies and are meant to provide you, the reader, with some examples to build upon. You can use these as a reference to create your own plan, so feel free to make a copy of this spreadsheet and customize it to your needs and wants.

### Estimating Active APY

Active Rewards are a bit more complicated and depend on many factors that are currently hard to predict accurately. It is unlikely for the user to get a practical result, which is why we don't offer a tool to estimate Active APY right now.

You can easily expand the spreadsheet above to support a basic, naive calculations for Active Rewards such as adding a fixed-rate.

To help solve this challenge, [we built a dashboard](https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df) that shows historical and ongoing summaries of APY, Data Consume Volume, and veOCEAN allocations per-round.

You can also [learn how rewards are calculated](../df-volumedf.md#how-rewards-are-calculated) to understand more about what's happening behind the scenes of each Data Farming round.

Finally, you can [review the implementation inside df-web](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-web/blob/main/src/utils/rewards.js) to understand how the APYs on the UI are calculated.
