# Using Ocean Subgraph

Ocean subgraph is an off-chain service that provides information about datatokens, users, and balances using GraphQL. The Ocean subgraph provides a faster way to fetch data rather than an on-chain query. The data from Ocean subgraph can be queried using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/).

You can use the Subgraph instances hosted by Ocean Protocol or host your instance. The page on Deploying Ocean Subgraph provides a guide on hosting your own Ocean Subgraph instance.

For each supported network, an individual Ocean subgraph is deployed. The information about supported networks are available on this [page](../../core-concepts/networks.md).

#### Ocean Subgraph GraphiQL

The below table provides the link to GraphiQL for the support networks. The Graphql queries can be directly executed using the GraphiQL interface without the need of any setup.
