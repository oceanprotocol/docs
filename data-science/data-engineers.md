# What data is valuable?

### Simple Truths

A lot of people miss the mark on tokenizing data that actually _sells_. If your goal is to make money, then you have to research target audiences, who's currently buying data, and \*correctly price\* your data to meet that demand.

To figure out which market segments are paying for data, then it may help you to **go to the Ocean Market and sort by Sales.**

But even then, it's not enough to just publish useful data on Ocean. **You need to market your data** **assets** to close sales.

Have you tried all these things and are still having trouble making money? Never fear! You can enter one of our [data challenges](https://oceanprotocol.com/challenges) to make sweet OCEAN rewards and build your data science skills.

But what if you're a well-heeled company looking to create dApps or source data predictions? You can kickstart the value creation loop by working with Ocean Protocol to [sponsor a data challenge](../user-guides/sponsor-a-data-challenge.md).

### What data could be useful for dApp builders?

* **Government Open Data:** Governments serve as a rich and reliable source of data. However, this data often lacks proper documentation or poses challenges for data scientists to work with effectively. One idea is to clean and organize this data in a way that others can tap into this wealth of information with ease. For example, in one of our [data challenges](https://desights.ai/shared/challenge/8) we leveraged public real estate data from Dubai to build use cases for understanding and predicting valuations and rents. Local, state, and federal governments around the world provide access to valuable data. So make consuming that data easier to help consumers build useful products and help your local community.
* **Public APIs:** Data scientists can use free, public APIs to tokenize data in such a way that consumers can easily access it. [This ](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)is a repository of some public APIs for a wide range of topics, from weather to gaming to finance.
* **On-Chain Data:** There is consistent demand for good decentralized finance (DeFi) data and an emerging need for decentralized social data. Thus, data scientists can query blockchain data to build and sell valuable datasets for consumers.
* **Datasets for training AI and foundation models:** Much of the uniqueness and value in your data consists of aggregating and cleaning data from different sources. You can scrape the web or source data from other sources to present to AI/ML engineers looking for data to train their models.
