# Bridges

On [March 26th](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/fetch-ai-ocean-protocol-and-singularitynet-unite-to-create-artificial-superintelligence-alliance-0768d608ecfa), Ocean Protocol, SingularityNET, and Fetch.ai joined forces to form the Superintelligence Alliance and announced a strategic merger of their tokens—OCEAN, FET, and AGIX—into a single unified token called “ASI.”

If you'd like to migrate your OCEAN tokens to FET, please follow the instructions below according to the network where you currently hold your tokens:
1) Ethereum (ERC-20):
For OCEAN tokens on the Ethereum network, you can participate in the Phase 1 migration to FET by visiting [here](https://singularitydao.ai/migrate-asi).
2) Polygon - For OCEAN tokens on the Polygon network, first swap them to the Polygon (POL) token, then send it to an exchange that has listed FET and do rest of the conversion there. You might come across the name "Matic" in some places instead of "Polygon" because the network is still using its old brand name in certain instances. Don't worry though, it's the same network whether you see Matic or Polygon.
3) Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) - If you hold OCEAN tokens on the Binance Smart Chain network, transfer them to Binance on the BEP-20 network, where you can convert them to FET.

For other bridges and networks, see the [Networks page](README.md).
