<summary><mark style="color:purple;">Build Your dApp</mark><br><br><strong>Building a</strong> <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/templates"><strong>dApp</strong></a> <strong>on top of Ocean Protocol provides you with a powerful framework to create decentralized applications that leverage the capabilities of the protocol. By utilizing Ocean's technology stack, you can tap into a robust ecosystem designed for data exchange and collaboration.</strong></summary>

When building a dApp on top of Ocean Protocol, you gain access to a wide range of features and functionalities:

1. **Data access and discovery**: Utilize Ocean's data marketplace infrastructure to access diverse and valuable data sets. Leverage the data discovery mechanisms to help users find relevant data assets for their applications.
2. **Data interoperability**: Seamlessly integrate and interact with various data sources using Ocean's standardized data representation formats. Ensure compatibility and easy data integration within your dApp.
3. **Data privacy and security**: Leverage the cryptographic capabilities of Ocean Protocol to ensure privacy and security of sensitive data. Implement access controls, encryption, and secure data-sharing mechanisms within your dApp.
4. **Provenance and transparency**: Leverage the transparency and immutability of the blockchain to establish data provenance. Build trust among users by providing an auditable record of data sources, usage, and transactions.
5. **Tokenized incentives**: Utilize datatokens (ERC20) within your dApp to incentivize data providers and consumers. Design token economies that align with the specific requirements of your application, encouraging participation and value creation.
6. **Community participation**: Leverage the community-driven nature of Ocean Protocol to foster collaboration, feedback, and innovation. Engage with the Ocean community to share ideas, contribute to the ecosystem, and gather insights to enhance your dApp.

These are a few examples of what can be built on top of Ocean.

<summary><mark style="color:orange;">Build Your Data Marketplace</mark><br><br>With Ocean Protocol, you have the flexibility to create and launch your own data marketplace tailored to your specific requirements. Utilize the protocol's infrastructure and tools to establish a platform where data providers and consumers can connect and transact. </summary>

You can choose from two options:

1. **Fork the** [**Ocean Marketplace**](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market) **and customize it**: You have the ability to fork the existing [Ocean Marketplace](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market) codebase and customize it according to your needs. This allows you to leverage the foundational infrastructure and functionality already built by Ocean Protocol while tailoring the user interface, features, and branding to align with your marketplace vision. Follow this [tutorial](../developers/build-a-marketplace/) to learn how to do it.
2. **Build your marketplace with Ocean components**: Alternatively, you can build your data marketplace from scratch using Ocean Protocol's modular components. Ocean provides a comprehensive set of building blocks, such as the [**Aquarius**](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius), [**Provider**](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider), Ocean [contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts), and Ocean libraries([**ocean.js**](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js) & [**ocean.py**](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py)), which you can integrate into your own marketplace development. This empowers you to create a unique and customized data marketplace experience while leveraging the underlying capabilities and standards provided by Ocean Protocol.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Buy or Sell Data</mark><br><br>Within the Ocean ecosystem, users have the possibility to publish and sell data or explore and purchase data. Data is published in the form of interoperable <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md">ERC721</a> data NFTs and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md">ERC20</a> datatokens. The platform acts as a decentralized exchange (DEX) specifically designed for data transactions. Every action, including publishing, purchasing, and consuming data, is securely recorded on the blockchain, creating a tamper-proof audit trail.</summary>

For data scientists and AI practitioners, Ocean presents opportunities such as increased access to a broader range of data, including private data, crypto-secured provenance for data and AI training, and potential income streams from selling and curating data.

To showcase these capabilities, Ocean developed a demonstrator marketplace known as the [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/).

The following guides will help you get started with buying and selling data:

* [Publish an NFT](../user-guides/marketplace-publish-data-asset.md)
* [Download an NFT](../user-guides/marketplace-download-data-asset.md)
* [Host Assets](../user-guides/asset-hosting/)
