# Explore

Ocean Protocol is a **decentralized data exchange protocol** that aims to unlock the value of data and enable secure and privacy-preserving on-chain data sharing and monetization ⛓️ It provides a framework for building data-centric applications that facilitate the exchange of data assets while ensuring data privacy, security, and compliance.

Ocean Protocol is used for a variety of purposes, including:

1. **Data Sharing**: Ocean Protocol allows individuals and organizations to share data securely and privately, enabling data owners to monetize their data assets while maintaining control over their data.
2. **Data Monetization**: Data owners can monetize their data by offering it for sale or by providing data services through compute-to-data (C2D) capabilities. Data consumers can access and utilize data assets.&#x20;
3. **Decentralized Data Marketplaces**: Ocean Protocol facilitates the creation of decentralized data marketplaces where data providers can list their data assets and data consumers can discover and access them. These marketplaces operate on a peer-to-peer basis, eliminating the need for intermediaries and providing more efficient and transparent data transactions.
4. **AI Development**: Ocean Protocol supports the development of AI models by providing access to diverse and high-quality datasets. Data scientists and AI developers can leverage these datasets to train and improve their models, leading to more accurate and robust AI systems.
5. **Access control:** Ocean Protocol incorporates token-gating mechanisms that grant or restrict access to specific data assets based on predefined criteria, ensuring controlled and regulated data sharing within the ecosystem.

By leveraging **blockchain technology** and **smart contracts**, Ocean Protocol offers **open-source tools** to securely publish [NFTs](../developers/contracts/data-nfts.md) of your data and algorithms to seamlessly collaborate, trade, and innovate with others.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Buy or Sell Data</mark><br><br>Users have the possibility to publish, purchase, and sell data within the Ocean ecosystem. Data is tokenized in the form of interoperable <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md">ERC721</a> data NFTs and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md">ERC20</a> datatokens. The platform acts as a decentralized exchange (DEX) specifically designed for data transactions. Every action, including publishing, purchasing, and consuming data, is securely recorded on the blockchain, creating a tamper-proof audit trail.</summary>

For data scientists and AI practitioners, Ocean presents opportunities such as increased access to a broader range of data, including private data, crypto-secured provenance for data and AI training, and potential income streams from selling and curating data.

To showcase these capabilities, Ocean developed a demonstrator marketplace known as the [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/).

The following guides will help you get started with buying and selling data:

* [Publish an NFT](../user-guides/publish-data-nfts.md)
* [Download an NFT](../user-guides/buy-data-nfts.md)
* [Host Assets](../user-guides/asset-hosting/README.md)

<summary><mark style="color:blue;">Manage datatokens and data NFTs for use in DeFi</mark><br><br>Ocean makes it easy to publish data services (deploy ERC721 data NFTs and ERC20 datatokens), and to consume data services (spend datatokens). Crypto wallets, exchanges, and DAOs become data wallets, exchanges, and DAOs.</summary>

Use Ocean [JavaScript](../developers/ocean.js/README.md) or [Python](../developers/ocean.py/README.md) drivers to manage data NFTs and datatokens:

Ocean-based apps make data assets on-ramps and off-ramps easy for end users. Ocean smart contracts and libraries make this easy for developers. The data itself does not need to be on-chain, just the access control.

Data NFTs are ERC721 tokens representing the unique asset and datatokens are ERC20 tokens to access data services. Each data service gets its own data NFT and one or more type of datatokens.

To access the dataset, you send 1.0 datatokens to the data provider (running Ocean Provider). To give access to someone else, send them 1.0 datatokens. That's it.

Since datatokens are ERC20, and live on Ethereum mainnet, there's a whole ecosystem to leverage.

* _Publish and access data services:_ downloadable files or compute-to-data. Use Ocean to deploy a new [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) and [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md) datatoken contract for each data service, then mint datatokens.
* _Transfer datatokens_ to another owner (or approve & transferFrom).
* _And more._ Use ERC20 support in [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/), [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#working-with-an-erc20-token-contract) and Solidity to connect datatokens with crypto wallets and other DeFi services.

<summary><a href="https://medium.com/p/477b3decad51#7922"><mark style="color:orange;">Run Your Own Provider</mark></a><br><br>You have the option to generate revenue by running your own <a href="../developers/provider/">provider</a>. It has come to our attention that many of you have not pursued this opportunity, primarily due to the lack of compelling incentives.</summary>

If you're not familiar with it, the Ocean [Provider](../developers/provider/README.md) serves as the proxy service responsible for encrypting/decrypting data and streaming it to the consumer. It also verifies user access privileges for specific data assets or services. It plays a vital role in the Ocean architecture.

Fees are now paid to the individual or organization running the provider when a user downloads a data asset. The download fees are set based on the cost per MB, and there is also a provider fee for compute jobs, which is priced per minute.

Both the download and compute fees can be set to any absolute amount, and you have the flexibility to choose the token in which you want to receive these fees. They do not have to be in the same currency used in the marketplace. For instance, the provider fee could be a fixed rate of 5 USDT per 1000 MB of data downloaded, and this fee will remain fixed in USDT even if the marketplace uses a different currency.

Furthermore, provider fees are not restricted to data consumption; they can also be utilized to charge for compute resources. For example, a provider can charge a fixed fee of 15 DAI to reserve compute resources for one hour. This presents an advantage for both the user and the provider host. Users can now reserve the appropriate amount of computing resources according to their requirements. For provider hosts, this creates an additional income opportunity.
