<summary>Build Your Token-gated AI dApp</summary>

Monetize by making your dApp token-gated. Users no longer have to use credit cards or manage OAuth credentials. Rather, they buy & spend ERC20 datatokens to access your dApp content.

Go further yet: rather than storing user profile data on your centralized server -- which exposes you to liability -- have it on-chain encrypted by the user's wallet, and just-in-time decrypt for the app.

<summary>Build Your Token-gated REST API</summary>

Focus on the backend: make a Web3-native REST API. Like the token-gated dApps, consumers of the REST API buy access with crypto, not credit cards.
