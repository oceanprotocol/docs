### What builders can do

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/general/dapps.png" alt=""></figure>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:purple;">Build Your Token-gated AI dApp</mark></summary>

Monetize by making your dApp token-gated. Users no longer have to use credit cards or manage OAuth credentials. Rather, they buy & spend ERC20 datatokens to access your dApp content.

Go further yet: rather than storing user profile data on your centralized server -- which exposes you to liability --  have it on-chain encrypted by the user's wallet, and just-in-time decrypt for the app.

</details>


<details>

<summary><mark style="color:purple;">Build Your Token-gated REST API</mark></summary>

Focus on the backend: make a Web3-native REST API. Like the token-gated dApps, consumers of the REST API buy access with crypto, not credit cards.

</details>


<details>

<summary><mark style="color:purple;">Build Your Data Market</mark></summary>

Build a decentralized data marketplace by [forking Ocean Market code](../developers/build-a-marketplace/) to quickly get something good, or by building up from Ocean components for a more custom look.

</details>

To dive deeper, please go to [Developers page](../developers/README.md).

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:red;">Use Ocean in Python</mark></summary>

The **[ocean.py](../data-scientists/ocean.py/README.md)** library is built for the key environment of data scientists: Python. Use it to earn $ from your data, share your data, get more data from others, and see provenance of data usage.

</details>


<details>

<summary><mark style="color:red;">Do crypto price predictions</mark></summary>

With [Ocean Predictoor](../predictoor/README.md), you submit predictions for the future price of BTC, ETH etc, and earn. The more accurate your predictions, the more $ you can earn.

</details>


<details>

<summary><mark style="color:red;">Compete in a Data Challenge</mark></summary>

Ocean regularly offer [data science challenges](../data-scientists/join-a-data-challenge) on real-world problems. Showcase your skills, and earn $ prizes.

</details>

To dive deeper, please go to [Data Scientists page](../data-scientists/README.md).


### What OCEAN holders can do

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:purple;">Earn Rewards via Data Farming</mark></summary>

Ocean's [Data Farming](../data-farming/README.md) incentives program enables OCEAN holders to earn by locking OCEAN, and curating data.
