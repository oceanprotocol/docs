# ðŸŒŠ Discover Ocean

Ocean's mission is to level the playing field for AI and data.

How? **By helping you monetize AI models, compute and data, while preserving privacy.**

Ocean is a decentralized data & compute protocol built to scale AI. Its core tech is:

* Data NFTs & datatokens, to enable token-gated access control, data wallets, data DAOs, and more.
* Compute-to-data: buy & sell private data, while preserving privacy
* Ocean Nodes: Monetizing globalized idle compute & turning it into a decentralized network, turning unused computing resources into a secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving infrastructure for AI training, inference, and data processing. 

### Ocean Users Are...

* [**Developers**](../developers/)**.** Build token-gated AI dApps, or run an Ocean Node.
* [**Data scientists**](../data-scientists/)**.** Earn via predictions, annotations & challenges
* [**Ocean ambassadors**](https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/community)
* [**Ocean Node Runners**](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/ocean-node)**.** Monetize your idle computing hardware
