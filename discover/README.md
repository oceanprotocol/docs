How? **By helping **_**you**_** monetize AI models and data, while preserving privacy.**

Ocean is a decentralized data exchange protocol to drive AI. Its core tech is:

* Data NFTs & datatokens, to enable token-gated access control, data wallets, data DAOs, and more.
* Compute-to-data: buy & sell private data, while preserving privacy
