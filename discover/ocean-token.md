## The OCEAN Token 

Since Oceanâ€™s departure from the ASI Alliance, the $OCEAN token is an ERC20 token solely representing the ideals of decentralized AI and data. 

It has no intended utility value nor is it a staking, platform, governance, payment, NFT, DeFi, meme, reward, or security token.

Its supply is capped at approximately 270,000,000. With buybacks and burns, the supply of $OCEAN will be decreasing over time.

Acquirors can currently exchange for $OCEAN on Coinbase, Kraken, UpBit, Binance US, Uniswap and SushiSwap.
Until 2024, the Ocean Token ($OCEAN) was the utility token powering the Ocean Protocol ecosystem, used for staking, governance, and purchasing data services, enabling secure, transparent, and decentralized data exchange and monetization.
