### Ocean Protocol Concepts

<details>

<summary>Ocean Protocol</summary>

Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange protocol that enables individuals and organizations to share, sell, and consume data in a secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving manner. The protocol is designed to address the current challenges in data sharing, such as data silos, lack of interoperability, and data privacy concerns. Ocean Protocol uses blockchain technology, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques to create a network where data providers can offer their data assets for sale, data consumers can purchase and access the data, and developers can build data-driven applications and services on top of the protocol.

</details>

<details>

<summary>OCEAN</summary>

The Ocean Protocol's token (OCEAN) is a utility token used in the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. It serves as a medium of exchange and a unit of value for data services in the network. Participants in the Ocean ecosystem can use OCEAN to buy and sell data, stake on data assets, and participate in the governance of the protocol.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Data Consume Volume (DCV)</summary>

The data consume value (DCV) is a key metric that refers to the amount of $ spent to buy data assets where the data assets are subsequently consumed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Transaction Volume (TV)</summary>

The transaction value is a key metric that refers to the value of transactions within the ecosystem.

Transaction volume(TV) is often used interchangeably with data consume volume (DCV). DCV is a more refined metric that excludes activities like wash trading. DCV measures the actual consumption or processing of data within the protocol, which is a more accurate measure of the value generated by the ecosystem.

<summary>veOCEAN</summary>

_ve_ tokens have been introduced by several projects such as [Curve](https://curve.fi/) and [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/). These tokens require users to lock _project tokens_ in return for _ve\<project tokens>_.

[veOCEAN](https://df.oceandao.org/veocean) gives token holders the ability to lock OCEAN to earn yield and curate data.

In exchange for locking tokens, users can earn rewards. The amount of reward depends on how long the tokens are locked. Furthermore, veTokens can be used for asset curation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Ocean Data Farming (DF)</summary>

[Ocean Data Farming (DF)](https://df.oceandao.org/) incentivizes for growth of Data Consume Volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. [DF](../data-farming/README.md) is like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned for DCV. DF emits OCEAN for passive rewards and active rewards.

* As a veOCEAN holder, you get _passive_ rewards by default.
* If you _actively_ curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), then you can earn more.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Passive Rewards</summary>

When a user locks their OCEAN for a finite period of time, they get veOCEAN in return. Based on the quantity of veOCEAN, the user accumulates weekly OCEAN rewards. Because rewards are generated without human intervention, these are called [Passive Rewards](../data-farming/README.md). OCEAN Data Farming Passive Rewards are claimable every Thursday on the [Rewards page](https://df.oceandao.org/rewards).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Volume DF</summary>

When a user allocates veOCEAN to Ocean Market projects, then weekly OCEAN rewards are given to a user based on the sales of those projects. Since these rewards depend on human intervention to decide the allocations, these are categorized as [Volume DF](../data-farming/README.md) rewards. OCEAN Data Farming Volume DF rewards are claimable every Thursday on the [Rewards page](https://df.oceandao.org/rewards).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Challenge DF</summary>

When users submit accurate predictions for the price of Ethereum to the [Challenge DF program](https://df.oceandao.org/challenge-df), they have a chance to win OCEAN rewards by being in the top 3 submissions based on predicted value accuracy. 

These rewards are classified as [Challenge DF](../data-farming/README.md) rewards since they require active participation in the challenge. Rewards can be claimed every Thursday on the [Rewards page](https://df.oceandao.org/rewards).

</details>

<details>

<summary>H2O</summary>

[H2O](https://www.h2odata.xyz/) is a decentralized protocol that introduced the first non-pegged stable asset, $H2O. Initially, it is backed by OCEAN but there are plans to be backed by other data tokens.

The H2O non-pegged stable asset is a friendly fork of RAI. Whereas RAI uses ether (ETH) as its asset for collateral, H2O uses OCEAN. The price of H2O is managed by an algorithm that rebalances to bring the redemption price close to the market price and participants are incentivized to aid in this process. Traditional stable assets are pegged to a price such as 1 USD. In contrast, RAI (and soon H2O) are free-floating but typically settle around a price; for RAI this has been \~$3.

</details>

<details>

<summary>$POSEIDON</summary>

The [POSEIDON token](https://docs.h2odata.xyz/protocol-overview/poseidon-mechanics) is the governance token of the H2O protocol. With the following function inside the protocol:

* Ungovernance: once governance minimization is finalized, POSEIDON holders will be able to remove control from any remaining components in H2O or, if needed, continue to manage components that may be challenging to ungovern (such as oracles or any other component interacting with other protocols).

</details>

<details>

<summary>$psdnOcean</summary>

[psdnOCEAN](https://docs.h2odata.xyz/protocol-overview/psdnocean-veocean-liquid-staking) is the liquid staking wrapper for veOCEAN.

* Convert OCEAN to psdnOCEAN with a 1:1 ratio.
* Gain access to a liquid asset and receive a share of the revenue of veOCEAN.

### Web3 Fundamentals

<details>

<summary>Web3</summary>

Web3 (also known as Web 3.0 or the decentralized web) is a term used to describe the next evolution of the internet, where decentralized technologies are used to enable greater privacy, security, and user control over data and digital assets.

While the current version of the web (Web 2.0) is characterized by centralized platforms and services that collect and control user data, Web3 aims to create a more decentralized and democratized web by leveraging technologies such as blockchain, peer-to-peer networking, and decentralized file storage.

Ocean Protocol is designed to be a Web3-compatible platform that allows users to create and operate decentralized data marketplaces. This means that data providers and consumers can transact directly with each other, without the need for intermediaries or centralized authorities.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Blockchain</summary>

A distributed ledger technology (DLT) that enables secure, transparent, and decentralized transactions. Blockchains use cryptography to maintain the integrity and security of the data they store.

By using blockchain technology, Ocean Protocol provides a transparent and secure way to share and monetize data, while also protecting the privacy and ownership rights of data providers. Additionally, blockchain technology enables the creation of immutable and auditable records of data transactions, which can be used for compliance, auditing, and other purposes.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Decentralization</summary>

Decentralization is the distribution of power, authority, or control away from a central authority or organization, towards a network of distributed nodes or participants. Decentralized systems are often characterized by their ability to operate without a central point of control, and their ability to resist censorship and manipulation.

In the context of Ocean Protocol, decentralization refers to the use of blockchain technology to create a decentralized data exchange protocol. Ocean Protocol leverages decentralization to enable the sharing and monetization of data while preserving privacy and data ownership.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Block Explorer</summary>

A tool that allows users to view information about transactions, blocks, and addresses on a blockchain network. Block explorers provide a [graphical interface](https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48) for interacting with a blockchain, and they allow users to search for specific transactions, view the details of individual blocks, and track the movement of cryptocurrency between addresses. Block explorers are commonly used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, developers, and businesses to monitor network activity and verify transactions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cryptocurrency</summary>

A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank. Cryptocurrencies use blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies to maintain their transaction history and prevent fraud.

Ocean Protocol uses a cryptocurrency called Ocean (OCEAN) as its native token. OCEAN is used as a means of payment for data transactions on the ecosystem, and it is also used to incentivize network participants, such as data providers, validators, and curators.

Like other cryptocurrencies, OCEAN operates on a blockchain, which ensures that transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable. The use of a cryptocurrency like OCEAN provides a number of benefits for the Ocean Protocol network, including faster transaction times, lower transaction fees, and greater transparency and trust.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Decentralized applications (dApps)</summary>

dApps (short for decentralized applications) are software applications that run on decentralized peer-to-peer networks, such as blockchain. Unlike traditional software applications that rely on a centralized server or infrastructure, dApps are designed to be decentralized, open-source, and community-driven.

dApps in the Ocean ecosystem are designed to enable secure and transparent data transactions between data providers and consumers, without the need for intermediaries or centralized authorities. These applications can take many forms, including data marketplaces, data analysis tools, data-sharing platforms, and many more. A good example of a dApp is the [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Interoperability</summary>

The ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other. Interoperability is important for creating a seamless user experience and enabling the transfer of value across different blockchain ecosystems.

In the context of Ocean Protocol, interoperability enables the integration of the protocol with other blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). This enables data providers and users to access and share data across different networks and applications, creating a more open and connected ecosystem for data exchange.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Smart contract</summary>

Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts that allow for the automation and verification of transactions without the need for a third party. They are programmed using code and operate on a decentralized blockchain network. Smart contracts are designed to enforce the rules and regulations of a contract, ensuring that all parties involved fulfill their obligations. Once the conditions of the contract are met, the smart contract automatically executes the transaction, ensuring that the terms of the contract are enforced in a transparent and secure manner.

Ocean ecosystem smart contracts are deployed on multiple blockchains like Polygon, Energy Web Chain, BNB Smart Chain, and others. The code is open source and available on the organization's [GitHub](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</summary>

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a virtual machine that runs on top of the Ethereum network, allowing developers to create and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the network. The EVM provides a platform for developers to create smart contracts in various programming languages, including Solidity, Vyper, and others.

The Ocean Protocol ecosystem is a decentralized data marketplace built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to provide a secure and transparent platform for sharing and selling data.

<details>

<summary>ERC</summary>

ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments and refers to a series of technical standards for Ethereum-based tokens and smart contracts. ERC standards are created and proposed by developers to the Ethereum community for discussion, review, and implementation. These standards ensure that smart contracts and tokens are compatible with other applications and platforms built on the Ethereum blockchain.

In the context of Ocean Protocol, several ERC standards are used to create and manage tokens on the network. Standards like [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155).

</details>

<details>

<summary>ERC-20</summary>

[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that defines a set of rules and requirements for creating tokens that are compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning they are interchangeable with other ERC-20 tokens and have a variety of use cases such as creating digital assets, utility tokens, or fundraising tokens for initial coin offerings (ICOs).

The ERC-20 standard is used for creating fungible tokens on the Ocean Protocol network. Fungible tokens are identical and interchangeable with each other, allowing them to be used interchangeably on the network.

</details>

<details>

<summary>ERC-721</summary>

[ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that defines a set of rules and requirements for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs). ERC-721 tokens are unique and cannot be exchanged for other tokens or assets on a one-to-one basis, making them ideal for creating digital assets such as collectibles, game items, and unique digital art.

The ERC-721 standard is used for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ocean Protocol network. NFTs are unique and non-interchangeable tokens that can represent a wide range of assets, such as digital art, collectibles, and more.

</details>

<details>

<summary>ERC-1155</summary>

[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) is a technical standard for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within the same contract. This makes it a "multi-token" standard that provides more flexibility than the earlier ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, which only allow for the creation of either fungible or non-fungible tokens, respectively.

The ERC-1155 standard is used for creating multi-token contracts on the Ocean Protocol network. Multi-token contracts allow for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within the same contract, providing greater flexibility for developers.
