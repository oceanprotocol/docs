## Content

The documentation is split in multiple sections whose content lives in this repo:

- **Core concepts**: high-level explanation of concepts, assumptions, and components
- **Setup**: getting started for various stakeholders and use cases
- **Tutorials**: detailed tutorials
- **API & Library References**: docs for the Aquarius & Brizo REST APIs, and docs for various Squid libraries

Those sections are defined in the [`/data/sections.yml`](data/sections.yml) file.

### Content Files

Some content files live in the [`/content`](content/) & [`/data`](data/) folders, and is written using Markdown and YAML.

That content is organized into subfolders corresponding to the sections mentioned above. The subfolder names, along with the filenames, define the final URL of a given piece of content.

The final navigational organization of the content is driven through the sidebar files under [`/data/sidebars`](data/sidebars/).

Some global values used throughout the site can be set in [`config.js`](config.js).

### External Content Files

Additionally, some content files live in other repositories and are maintained there. They are pulled into Gatsby's data layer at build time, and pages are created automatically for them as defined in [gatsby-node.js](gatsby-node.js).

At the moment, this is set up for the following repositories:

- [dev-ocean](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean)

For including a document from any of the above repositories, 4 values are required in a document's YAML frontmatter. If found, a page will be generated automatically, accessible under the defined `slug`.

This will NOT include this page in the doc's sidebar navigation, this needs to be done manually in the docs repo in one of the sidebar files. This is so you can check out everything before exposing it to visitors, and to ensure editorial workflow of the categorization.

### Markdown File Requirements

All Markdown files should use
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) and must satisfy some extra requirements:

1. The file must begin with a section called YAML frontmatter that looks like this:

```md
---
title: This is the Title in Title Case
description: A short description of the page.
---

Markdown content begins here.
```

For external documents in other repos, defining the `slug` and `section` is required:

```md
---
title: This is the Title in Title Case
description: A short description of the page.
slug: /concepts/architecture/
section: concepts
---

Markdown content begins here.
```

Note: The `description` value will be rendered on-page below the title, and it will also be used for description tags in the HTML head.

1. Don't include the page title or description in the Markdown section. That is, don't begin the Markdown content with `# This is the Title in Title Case`. Just write as if that were already there.
2. start your heading levels with `h2`, so `## My heading`
3. Internal links to other docs pages should be:
   - to a absolute URL without the host, that looks like `/concepts/terminology/` with slashes on the beginning and end, and with no `.md` or `.html` at the end (before the last slash).
   - when linking from external repos, to the _full absolute URL_, such as `https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/hello/you-are-awesome/`
4. no TOC please, this will be generated automatically from all headings
5. for images and media, you can keep them in the original repo. Images will be automatically grabbed by the docs site on querying. When doing that, docs site will generate all sorts of image sizes to handle proper responsive images, so no need to keep an eye on image dimensions or file sizes

**Have a look at [docs.oceanprotocol.com/test/](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/test/) to see what content elements can be used in all Markdown files included in docs site.**

### Adding Docs

1. Add new Markdown file under one of the folders under [`/content`](content/)
1. Add new path to one of the sidebars in [`/data/sidebars`](data/sidebars/)
1. Push your changes to a new branch in the repo, or in your fork
1. Open a pull request against `master`, automatically asking for review
1. Wait for review, possibly make requested changes
1. Wait for all checks to pass
1. Merge!

### Editing Docs

Every article on [docs.oceanprotocol.com](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com) ends with an _Edit this page on GitHub_ link. Clicking that will put you to the right place in the repository from where you can hit the _Edit_ pencil icon on GitHub.

GitHub will automatically fork the repository if you are not part of the `oceanprotocol` organisation on GitHub. Members can simply push to a new branch on the original repo.

The editing workflow is as follows:

1. Make your changes
1. Push your changes to a new branch in the repo, or in your fork
1. Open a pull request against `master`, automatically asking for review
1. Wait for review, possibly make requested changes
1. Wait for all checks to pass
1. Merge!

### Repositories

Includes a repository component which can be used throughout the site and in all Markdown documents.

On the front page it is used to show an overview of all our key repositories. This repositories list is sourced from the [`/data/repositories.yml`](data/repositories.yml) file, defining the grouping, the display order, which repos to include, and what additional links to show for every repository.

Including a repo on the front page requires only the `name` key and value, and it needs to be exactly the same as the repo name on GitHub:

```yaml
- name: pleuston
```

Additional information about a repo will then be [fetched automatically from GitHub](#github-data-fetching). The above example will result in:

<img width="547" alt="screen shot 2018-11-10 at 22 43 41" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/48306511-164fea00-e53a-11e8-97d6-c481ea087c7d.png">

This repository component can also be used within any Markdown content like so:

```html
<repo name="pleuston"></repo>
```

You can also add a private repo to prepare for a release, it will show up as soon as it is made public on GitHub.

#### Add Links to a Repository

You can attach multiple links to a repo by attaching them to the respective repo in the [`/data/repositories.yml`](data/repositories.yml) file:

```yaml
- name: keeper-contracts
  links:
    - name: Documentation
      url: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts/tree/develop/doc
    - name: TCR Owner's Manual
      url: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts/blob/develop/doc/owners_manual.md
```

The GitHub link is automatically added for every repository and will always be displayed.

#### Release Versions

The displayed version number is based on the tag name of the latest release for a given repository. That means only GitHub releases will trigger a version number update, creating a new Git tag alone is not sufficient.

### API & Library References

You can add more Markdown documents under `/content/references/`, link to them from the [`/data/sidebars/references.yml`](./data/sidebars/references.yml), and they will appear just like in all the other sections.

But the actual reference pages in this section are constructed from data files during site build (as defined in [`gatsby-node.js`](./gatsby-node.js)) with their own little rules. Generally, you can't edit their content within this site, you have to go to the respective repository and edit the documentation strings living with the source code.

The sidebar for those generated reference pages will automatically switch to include the table of contents of those pages so no need to define additional links in the [`/data/sidebars/references.yml`](./data/sidebars/references.yml) file for them.

#### TypeDoc specs

Reference pages based on generated `json` file from TypeDoc. TypeScript-based projects are included as git submodules under `./external`.

On site build, TypeDoc will automatically generate the required `json` spec file into `./data/squid-js.json` and create pages from it. The data from these json files is then used by the TypeDoc template.

To update the specs to the most recent version, the `./external/squid-js` submodule needs to be manuall updated. That's it, on next site build a new spec will be used.

## Development

The site is a React app built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

This Git repo has [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). They are the subdirectories of `external/`. Each one is basically another Git repo, i.e. an external Git repo that just _looks_ like it's part of this Git repo. It's very easy to get Git into a confusing state when there are submodules. If you follow the following tips, you should probably be okay:

1. Clone this repo using:

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docs.git
   ```

2. Don't edit anything in the submodules (i.e. in `external/`). Instead, edit it over in the other Git repository and merge your changes over there.
3. Get all the submodules up-to-date using:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --remote --recursive
   ```

   That will get each submodule up-to-date with the HEAD commit of some branch in a remote repository. Which branch? That's set in the `.gitmodules` file. You can check the current commit hashes of all the submodules using `git submodule status`

4. Before doing any `git checkout ...` or other normal Git operations, do this:

   ```bash
   git config --global submodule.recurse true
   ```

   That's like adding the `--recurse-submodules` option to all those Git commands (except for `git clone`) so you don't have to.

### Using npm

As a prerequisite, you'll need the following on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm
- Your `GITHUB_TOKEN`, see [GitHub GraphQL API](#github-graphql-api)

Clone this repo, install all dependencies, and start the development server:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docs.git
cd docs/

# add GITHUB_TOKEN
cp .env.sample .env
vi .env

npm i
npm start
```

This will start a hot-reloading local server exposed under [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Using Docker

Alternatively, you can use Docker for which you need to have installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Your `GITHUB_TOKEN`, see [GitHub GraphQL API](#github-graphql-api)

Then use Docker Compose to bring everything up:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docs.git
cd docs/

# add GITHUB_TOKEN
cp .env.sample .env
vi .env

docker-compose up
```

This will expose a hot-reloading server under [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Linting & Formatting

To enforce a consistent code style, linting is setup for pretty much every file. Linting is part of the test suite, meaning builds on Travis will fail in case of linting errors.

In this repo the following tools are setup for that:

- ESLint with [eslint-config-oceanprotocol](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/eslint-config-oceanprotocol)
- Stylelint with [stylelint-config-bigchaindb](https://github.com/bigchaindb/stylelint-config-bigchaindb)
- [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io)

```bash
# only run linting checks
npm run lint

# auto-formatting of all js, css, md, yml files
npm run format
```

### Editor Setup: VS Code

If you use VS Code as your editor, you can install those extensions to get linting as you type, and auto-formatting as you save:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shinnn.stylelint)
- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

## GitHub Data Fetching

Currently, there are three ways of getting data from GitHub to construct various parts of the docs site:

- as [external content files](#external-content-files) via Git submodules of selected repos, on build time
- via GitHub's GraphQL API v4, on build time
- via GitHub's FETCH API v3, on run time

### GitHub GraphQL API

The GitHub GraphQL API integration is done through [gatsby-source-graphql](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-graphql/) and requires authorization.

An environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to present, filled with a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the scope `public_repo`.

For local development, you can simply [create a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and use it in your local .env file:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
vi .env
# GITHUB_TOKEN=add_your_token_here
```

When running the site locally, you can use the GraphiQL client running under [localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) to explore the whole GraphQL layer of the site (not just the GitHub infos).

<img width="982" alt="screen shot 2018-11-10 at 18 41 45" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/48304718-66b94e80-e51e-11e8-8333-e5cadbf4d4b8.png">

This query should get you started to explore what information you can get from GitHub. All that is described in [GitHub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) can be used :

```graphql
query {
  github {
    organization(login: "oceanprotocol") {
      repositories(first: 100) {
        edges {
          node {
            name
            description
            url
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### GitHub REST API

The GitHub GraphQL API is only queried on build time, further GitHub updates on client side need to be done through additional fetch API calls. At the moment this is done for the [repositories](#repositories) component, where the stars and forks numbers are updated on client-side.

We use [github-projects](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/github-projects) for all communications with the [GitHub REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/), deployed on [Now](https://zeit.co/now).

This microservice should be used for all client-side integrations for performance and security reasons, required changes in data structure should be done over there. This service does data refetching automatically, caches results for 15min, and it has access to a secret GitHub token for making authorized API calls.

As a next step, using the REST API could be made obsolete by using some GraphQL client like [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) to query GitHub's GraphQL API on run time too.

## Deployment

Automatic deployments are triggered upon successful tests & builds on Travis:

- push to `master` initiates a live deployment
  -> [docs.oceanprotocol.com](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com)
- any Pull Request, and subsequent pushes to it, initiates a beta deployment
  -> [betadocs.oceanprotocol.com](https://betadocs.oceanprotocol.com)

The deploy command simply calls the [`scripts/deploy.sh`](scripts/deploy.sh) script, syncing the contents of the `public/` folder to S3:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Requires authorization against AWS with [one of the various ways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html), on Travis this is done with those environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
