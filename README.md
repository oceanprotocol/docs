# Ocean Documentation

## What is Ocean?

Ocean provides the next generation of tools to unlock data at a large scale.
## What is our Mission?

**To unlock data, for more equitable outcomes for users of data, using a thoughtful application of both technology and governance.**

Society is becoming increasingly reliant on data, especially with the advent of AI. However, a small handful of organizations with both massive data assets and AI capabilities attained worrying levels of control which is a danger to a free and open society.

Our team and community is committed to kick-starting a New Data Economy that reaches every single person, company and device, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our world.

Find out more about the people building Ocean on our [site](https://oceanprotocol.com/about).

## What can you do with Ocean?

### Build Data Markets

Use Ocean Protocol software tools to build your own data marketplace, by either forking [Ocean Market](https://v4.market.oceanprotocol.com/) code or building up with Ocean components.

### Manage datatokens and data NFTs for use in DeFi

Use Ocean [JavaScript](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js) or [Python](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py) drivers to manage data NFTs and datatokens:

### Compute-to-Data

Ocean's "Compute-to-Data" feature gives compute access to privately-held data, which never leaves the data ownerâ€™s premises. Ocean-based marketplaces enable the monetization of private data while preserving privacy. [Here](tutorials/compute-to-data-architecture/) are details.

## How does it work?

In Ocean Protocol, each asset gets its own ERC721 **data NFT** and one(or more) ERC20 **datatokens**. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by directly leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and more.

OCEAN token is used for staking, and more. [Here](https://oceanprotocol.com/token) are details.

Ocean Protocol provides tools for developers to _build data markets_, and to _manage data NFTs and datatokens_ for use in DeFi.

* _Publish and access data services:_ downloadable files or compute-to-data. Use Ocean to deploy a new [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) and [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md) datatoken contract for each data service, then mint datatokens.
* _Transfer datatokens_ to another owner (or approve & transferFrom).
* _And more._ Use ERC20 support in [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/), [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#working-with-an-erc20-token-contract) and Solidity to connect datatokens with crypto wallets and other DeFi services.
