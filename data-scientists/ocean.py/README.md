# Ocean.py

[Ocean.py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py) helps data scientists earn $ from their AI models, track provenance of data & compute, and get more data. (More details [here](../../data-scientists/README.md).)

Ocean.py makes these tasks easy:

* **Publish** data services: data feeds, REST APIs, downloadable files or compute-to-data. Create an ERC721 **data NFT** for each service, and ERC20 **datatoken** for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
* **Sell** datatokens via for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
* **Transfer** data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions using web3.

As a Python library, Ocean.py is built for the key environment of data scientists. It that can simply be imported alongside other Python data science tools like numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn and tensorflow.

### Quickstart üöÄ

Follow these steps in sequence to ramp into Ocean.

1. [Install Ocean](install.md) üì•
2. Setup üõ†Ô∏è
   - [Remote ](remote-setup.md)(Win, MacOS, Linux)
   - or [Local ](local-setup.md)(Linux only)
3. [Publish asset](publish-flow.md), post for free / for sale, dispense it / buy it, and [consume ](consume-flow.md)it
4. Run algorithms through [Compute-to-Data flow](compute-flow.md) using Ocean environment.

After these quickstart steps, the main [README](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/README.md) points to several other use cases, such as [Volume Data Farming](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/df.md), on-chain key-value stores ([public](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/key-value-public.md) or [private](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/key-value-private.md)), and other types of data assets ([REST API](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-restapi.md), [GraphQL](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-graphql.md), [on-chain](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-onchain.md)).
