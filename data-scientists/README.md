# 📊 Data Scientists

### How does Ocean benefit data scientists?

It offers three main benefits:

* **Earn.** You can earn $ by doing crypto price predictions via [Predictoor](../predictoor.md), by curating data in [Data Farming](../data-farming/), competing in a [data challenge](join-a-data-challenge.md), and by selling data & models.
* **More Data.** Use [Compute-to-Data](../developers/compute-to-data/) to access private data to run your AI modeling algorithms against, data which was previously inaccessible. Browse [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com) and other Ocean-powered markets to find more data to improve your AI models.
* **Provenance.** The acts of publishing data, purchasing data, and consuming data are all recorded on the blockchain to make a tamper-proof audit trail. Know where your AI training data came from!

### How do data scientists start using Ocean?

Here are the most relevant Ocean tools to work with:

* The [**ocean.py**](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/docs/blob/main/data-scientists/ocean.py) library is built for the key environment of data scientists: Python. It can simply be imported alongside other Python data science tools like numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn and tensorflow. You can use it to publish & sell data assets, buy assets, transfer ownership, and more.
* Predictoor's [**pdr-backend repo**](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend) has Python-based tools to run bots for crypto prediction or trading.
* [**Compete in a data challenge**](join-a-data-challenge.md), or [sponsor one](sponsor-a-data-challenge.md).

### Are there mental models for earning $ in data?

Yes. This section has two other pages which elaborate:

* [The Data Value Creation Loop](the-data-value-creation-loop.md) lays out the life cycle of data, and how to focus towards high-value use cases.
* [What data is valuable](data-engineers.md) helps think about pricing data.

The blog post ["How Ocean Can Benefit Data Scientists"](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/how-ocean-can-benefit-data-scientists-7e502e5f1a5f) elaborates further on the benefits of more data, provenance, and earning.
