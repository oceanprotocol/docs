description: An overview of public test networks that you can test Ocean Protocol applications against.
---

You can test an Ocean Protocol application (such as a marketplace) against the test networks (testnets) described below. This page is a brief overview of those testnets. The [tutorials](/tutorials/) cover more details (e.g. how to connect to specific ones).

## The Kovan Testnet

The [Kovan Testnet](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) (or just "Kovan") is a public Ethereum Testnet operated by members of the Ethereum community.
The Ocean Protocol keeper contracts are deployed to the Kovan Testnet.

For developers building on Ocean Protocol, we recommend starting with a [Spree Testnet](#a-spree-testnet-for-local-development).

### Kovan Blockchain Explorers

There are some Kovan blockchain explorers, e.g. [Etherscan for Kovan](https://kovan.etherscan.io/) and [BlockScout for Kovan](https://blockscout.com/eth/kovan). You can use those to check the status of a transaction, the balance of an account, and more.

### Ocean Components Connected to Kovan

There is a [Secret Store](/concepts/components/#secret-store) connected to the Kovan Testnet for use by Ocean Protocol projects (including your projects). It's operated by BigchainDB GmbH. Its URL is:

[https://secret-store-kovan.dev-ocean.com/](https://secret-store-kovan.dev-ocean.com/)

Aside from the Secret Store, there is no other Ocean Protocol software component (e.g. Aquarius) that is live, connected to the Kovan Testnet, and operated by BigchainDB GmbH.

### Using Barge with Kovan

If you run [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) with the the `--local-kovan-node` option, then Barge will run a Kovan node on your local machine (along with everything else Barge runs). There are many blocks in the Kovan Testnet's blockchain, so it can take a long time for your local Kovan node to sync, i.e. to download a local copy of all the blocks. **In the meantime, the local Kovan node won't be able to do certain things.**

## The Nile Testnet

_Also known as the Beta Network or Nile Beta Network. Formerly called the Ocean POA Testnet._

The Nile Testnet is similar to the Kovan Testnet, except all the nodes are operated by BigchainDB GmbH.

For developers building on Ocean Protocol, we recommend starting with a [Spree Testnet](#a-spree-testnet-for-local-development).

### Connect to the Nile Testnet

See the [tutorial page about connecting to Ocean-related networks](/tutorials/connect-to-networks/#connect-to-the-nile-testnet).

### Nile Blockchain Explorers

There is a Nile blockchain explorer at [https://submarine.dev-ocean.com/](https://submarine.dev-ocean.com/). You can use it to check the status of a transaction, the balance of an account, and more. It uses the following symbols for Nile Ether and Nile Ocean Tokens:

| Cryptocurrency    | Symbol used      |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Nile Ether        | POA              |
| Nile Ocean Tokens | OCEAN or SBT-OCN |

### Ocean Components Connected to Nile

There are several Ocean Protocol software components that are live, connected to the Nile Testnet, and operated by BigchainDB GmbH:

- Secret Store at [https://secret-store.dev-ocean.com](https://secret-store.dev-ocean.com)
- Aquarius at [https://nginx-aquarius.dev-ocean.com](https://nginx-aquarius.dev-ocean.com)
- Brizo at [https://nginx-brizo.dev-ocean.com](https://nginx-brizo.dev-ocean.com)
- Jupyter Hub at [https://mantaray.dev-ocean.com](https://mantaray.dev-ocean.com)
- [Token Bridge Frontend](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/bridge-ui) (for a token bridge between Nile and Kovan) at [https://token-bridge.dev-ocean.com](https://token-bridge.dev-ocean.com)
- Commons Marketplace at [https://commons.oceanprotocol.com](https://commons.oceanprotocol.com)

> Internal note: The private "atlantic" repo documents the internal details of the Nile Testnet in `networks/nile/README.md`.

### Using Barge with Nile

If you run [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) with the the `--local-nile-node` option, then Barge will run a Nile node on your local machine (along with everything else Barge runs). There might be many blocks in the Nile Testnet's blockchain, so it might take a long time for your local Nile node to sync, i.e. to download a local copy of all the blocks. **In the meantime, the local Nile node won't be able to do certain things.**

## A Spree Testnet (for Local Development)

When Ocean Protocol developers run [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) with the `--local-spree-node` option, a "Spree Testnet" is deployed on their local machine: a local testnet not connected to any external public testnet.

When running a Spree Testnet, you can connect to a node at RPC URL [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545) (called "Localhost 8545" in MetaMask).

Spree Testnet details can be found in the [Barge README.md file](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge/blob/develop/README.md). You can configure the Spree nodes by editing the files in the `barge/networks/spree/` directory.

Note: Spree testnets are named after the Spree River, the main river flowing through Berlin, Germany, where many Ocean Protocol developers are located.

## A Ganache-Based Testnet (for Local Development)

A local testnet similar to Spree but launched by using the `--local-ganache-node` option with Barge.

Note: You shouldn't use a Ganache-Based Testnet unless you know why you're doing so. For example, a Ganache-based testnet can be used to test some smart contracts, but it can't be used with a Secret Store.
