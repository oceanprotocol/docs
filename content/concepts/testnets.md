description: An overview of public testnets that you can test Ocean Protocol applications against.
---

You can test an Ocean Protocol application (such as a marketplace) against some testnets that are maintained by the Ocean Protocol Foundation and others.

## Kovan Testnet

The [Kovan Testnet](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) (or just "Kovan") is a public Ethereum testnet operated by members of the Ethereum community. The Ocean Protocol [keeper contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) (smart contracts) are deployed there.

Moreover, there is a [Secret Store](/concepts/components/#secret-store) operated by the Ocean Protocol Foundation which is connected to the Kovan Testnet.

## Nile Testnet

_Formerly called the Ocean POA Tesnet._

The Nile Testnet is similar to the Kovan Testnet, except all the nodes are operated by the Ocean Protocol Foundation. The Ocean Protocol [keeper contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) (smart contracts) are deployed there.

Moreover, there is a [Secret Store](/concepts/components/#secret-store) operated by the Ocean Protocol Foundation which is connected to the Nile Testnet.
