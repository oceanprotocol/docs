title: Role-Based Access Control Server

The primary mechanism for restricting your users ability to publish, consume, or browse is the role-based access (RBAC) control server. The RBAC server defines four different roles: 

- Admin
- Publisher
- Consumer
- User

## Admin/ Publisher
Currently both users with either the admin or publisher roles will be able to use the Market without any restrictions. They can publish, consume and browse datasets. 

## Consumer
A user with the consumer is able to browse datasets, purchase them, trade datatokens and also contribute to datapools. However, they are not able to publish datasets. 

## Users
Users are able to browse and search datasets but they are not able to purchase datasets, trade datatokens, or contribute to data pools. They are also not able to publish datasets. 

## Users without a role
If a user attempts to view the data market without a role, or without a wallet connected, they will not be able to view or search any of the datasets.
