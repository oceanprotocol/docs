## Connect to the Kovan Testnet

Most Ethereum wallets and libraries know how to connect to the [Kovan Testnet](/concepts/testnets/#the-kovan-testnet). In MetaMask, click on the network name then click on "Kovan Test Network" in the drop-down list.

If you're using [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) to run a local Kovan node, you can connect to that local Kovan node at RPC URL [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545) (called "Localhost 8545" in MetaMask).

## Connect to the Nile Testnet

Here are the parameters you might need to connect to the [Nile Testnet](/concepts/testnets/#the-nile-testnet):

| Parameter          | Value                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| RPC URL (required) | [https://nile.dev-ocean.com/](https://nile.dev-ocean.com/) |
| ChainID            | `8995` (decimal for MetaMask) or `0x2323` (hexadecimal)    |
| Symbol             | Whatever you like, e.g. `NILE ETH`                         |
| Nickname           | Whatever you like, e.g. `Nile Testnet`                     |

In MetaMask, click on the network name then click on `Custom RPC` in the drop-down list. Scroll down to the `New Network` section. Enter the above RPC URL. You don't need to add a port number to the end of the RPC URL. Enter the ChainID, Symbol and Nickname if you like. See the [MetaMask docs about how it uses the ChainID](https://metamask.github.io/metamask-docs/Main_Concepts/Sending_Transactions).

If you're using [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) to run a local Nile node, you can connect to that local Nile node at RPC URL [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545) (called "Localhost 8545" in MetaMask). You can configure that local Nile node by editing the files in the `barge/networks/nile/config/` directory.

## Connect to a Local Spree Testnet or Ganache-Based Testnet

When using [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) to run a purely-local testnet (Spree or Ganache-based), you can connect to a local node at RPC URL [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545) (called "Localhost 8545" in MetaMask).
