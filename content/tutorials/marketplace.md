Ocean Protocol's [marketplace](https://v4.market.oceanprotocol.com/) provides a web interface for accessing assets published on the chain. By default, assets metadata is pulled from Aquarius, component hosted by Ocean Protocol. To extend the existing features of the marketplace, developers can fork the marketplace.
