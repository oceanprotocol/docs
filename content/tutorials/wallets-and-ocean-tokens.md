title: Use Your Wallet to Manage Ocean Tokens
description: How to use crypto wallet software to check your Ocean Token balance and to send Ocean Tokens to others.
---

If you don't see any Ocean Tokens in your crypto wallet software (e.g. MetaMask or MyEtherWallet), don't worry! It might not know how to manage Ocean Tokens yet.

## Token Information

Almost all ERC-20 wallets require these values for adding a custom token:

- Contract Address: `0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48`
- Symbol: `OCEAN`
- Number of precision: `18`

## MetaMask

1. Make sure MetaMask is connected to the Ethereum Mainnet.
2. Select the account you want to manage.
3. Scroll down until the `Add Token` link is visible, then click on it.
4. Click on `Custom Token`.
5. Paste the Ocean Token contract address listed above into the _Token Contract Address_ field. The other two fields should auto-fill. If not, add `OCEAN` for the symbol and `18` for the precision.
6. Click `Next`.
7. Click `Add Tokens`.

MetaMask should now show your Ocean Token (OCEAN) balance, and when you're looking at that, there should be a `Send` button to send Ocean Tokens to others. For help with that, see [the MetaMask docs about how to send tokens](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488931-How-to-Send-Tokens).
