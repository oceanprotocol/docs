description: Try some online interactive squid-py tutorials.

You can go through interactive squid-py tutorials at [datascience.oceanprotocol.com](https://datascience.oceanprotocol.com/).
They're [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) running on your own [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) instance.
It's quite easy to figure out, but if you get stuck, here are some initial steps:

- Visit [datascience.oceanprotocol.com](https://datascience.oceanprotocol.com/).
- Click the **JupyterLab Instance** button.
- Login with your GitHub account.
- Once you're in the JupyterLab console, double-click on **mantaray_jupyter**.
- Double-click on **introdution.txt** and read it.
- Double-click on one of the **.ipynb** files. They're labelled to appear in a logical order.
- When asked to select a kernel, select Python 3.
- To make stuff happen (e.g. to run code cells), use the menus at the top of the JupyterLab console, or at the top of your current Jupyter notebook.
