description: Control who can publish, consume or browse data

Ocean Protocol supports fine-grained permissions across our technology stack which can be particularly useful for enterprise use-cases. There are two ways in which permissions are implemented: 

- [Role based access control server.](./rbac)

- [Allow & deny lists.](./allow-deny-lists) 

Neither are enabled in [Ocean Market](market.oceanprotocol.com/) but you can enable them in your own market by following the guides above.
