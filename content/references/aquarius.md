description: Where to find the Aquarius API reference docs.

SwaggerHub hosts Aquarius API reference docs for some versions of Aquarius:

- [Version 0.2.2](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Ocean-Protocol/aquarius/0.2.2)
- More versions coming soon

Tip 1: If you're not sure which version an Aquarius instance is serving, then look in its Swagger spec file at `{Aquarius URL}/spec`. For example, the Aquarius instance associated with the Nile Testnet has its Swagger API Spec at:

[https://nginx-aquarius.dev-ocean.com/spec](https://nginx-aquarius.dev-ocean.com/spec)

Tip 2: If you're running a local instance of Aquarius, then see the [Aquarius GitHub repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius) for information about how to see its API docs.
