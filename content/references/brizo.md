description: Where to find the Brizo API reference docs.

SwaggerHub hosts Brizo API reference docs for some versions of Brizo:

- [Version 0.3.5](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Ocean-Protocol/brizo/0.3.5)
- More versions coming soon

Tip 1: If you're not sure which version an Brizo instance is serving, then look in its Swagger spec file at `{Brizo URL}/spec`. For example, the Brizo instance associated with the Nile Testnet has its Swagger API Spec at:

[https://nginx-brizo.dev-ocean.com/spec](https://nginx-brizo.dev-ocean.com/spec)

Tip 2: If you're running a local instance of Brizo, then see the [Brizo GitHub repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/brizo) for information about how to see its API docs.
