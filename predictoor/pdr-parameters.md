## Feeds Published
For testnet, there are 10 feeds: X/USDT pair for each of the top-10 coins by market cap (ignoring stablecoins), 5m timescales, on Binance, >0% fees on Binance. Paid feeds. The coins are: X = BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, SOL, LTC, TRX, DOT  

For both testnet and mainnet, there are 20 feeds:  
- X/USDT pair for each of the top-10 coins by market cap (ignoring stablecoins), on Binance, 5m timescales, on Binance. The coins are: X = BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, SOL, LTC, TRX, DOT  
- Like above, but for 60m timescales  

## Pricing
For each timescale, one feed is free: BTC/UTD on Binance.  Below is pricing for the remaining feeds.   

The price to subscribe to one feed for 24 hours is 3.00 OCEAN. This includes all fees. Fee details:  
- 0.1% community swap fee  
- 20% fee to Ocean Protocol Foundation. (Will be used to further drive Predictoor, and to burn OCEAN.)  
- For reference, price without fees is 2.49791840133 OCEAN. To calculate this: Let x = price without fees. Then x * (1 + 0.20 + 0.001) = 3.0 â†’ x = 3.0 / (1 + 0.20 + 0.001) = 2.49791840133  

Pricing is subject to change based on learnings, and feedback from community.
