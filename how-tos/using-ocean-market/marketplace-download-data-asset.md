# Download Assets

### Find the Asset

1. Go to the Ocean [Market](https://v4.market.oceanprotocol.com/).
2. Search for the asset using the search bar in the top right corner of the page. The Ocean Marketplace provides features to search the Data/Algorithms by text, and users can also sort the result by published date.
3. Connect your wallet. If you know the network the asset is hosted on, then you can select the network from the dropdown to the left of the Connect Wallet button to filter!
