**Anyone could buy your  NFT assets and then publicly share them all over the internet.** Pretty scary, right? But what if there was a way that buyers could access valuable insights from your data and algorithms without actually \*seeing\* the data or algorithms themselves? We have a solution for that!

Enter, **Compute-to-Data** (also lovingly called C2D ðŸ¥°). Ocean Protocol's C2D feature enables you to monetize the OUTPUT of compute jobs on your datasets without revealing the contents of the data/algorithms themselves. Let's dive in how!

## How to Compute-to-Data ðŸ’ƒ

You will need to accomplish **3 main steps** in establishing a compute-to-data flow: [create an algorithm](make-a-boss-c2d-algorithm.md) that's compatible with C2D, [publish your C2D-specific algorithm NFT](publish-a-c2d-algorithm-nft.md), then [publish your data NFT with C2D configurations](publish-a-c2d-data-nft.md) allowing the algorithm to compute on it. That's it! Then you'll be able to sell compute jobs ðŸ¤© Follow the steps in this section's three subpages to create & sell a compute job from start to finish. ðŸ’ªðŸ˜ƒ
