### First time claiming?

You will need to wait at least one week, but not more than two weeks to claim your rewards for the first time. Check back on Thursday!

### Forgot to claim?

If you forget to claim your OCEAN rewards, then do not worry because they continue to accumulate! It's all fine. You can claim them anytime after Thursday. üòÉ
