**This page** is about Predictoor DF, and [this page](predictoordf-guide.md) is a guide.

# Predictoor DF Overview

**Predictoor DF** is a substream of Active DF that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via extra sales to Ocean Predictoor data feeds.

Predictoor DF has 37,500 OCEAN weekly rewards (ongoing) and 20,000 ROSE weekly rewards (throughout 2024).

The higher baseline sales makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.

## Introduction

**[Ocean Predictoor](../predictoor/README.md)** data feeds predict whether BTC, ETH etc will rise or fall 5min or 1h into the future. These feeds are crowdsourced by “predictoors”: people running AI-powered prediction bots.

**[Data Farming (DF)](../data-farming/README.md)** is Ocean’s incentive program, that rewards OCEAN to people who lock OCEAN or do active DF activities.

You should be familiar with both Predictoor and DF before reading on.

**Predictoor Data Farming is a substream of Active DF. It amplifies existing predictoors’ earnings based on their accuracy and stake.**

## Predictoor DF Timing

Predictoor DF starts counting on Nov 9, 23, at the beginning of Data Farming Round 63 (DF63). It runs indefinitely.

## Predictoor DF Rewards

Predictoor DF has two components: [OCEAN](https://oceanprotocol.com/about-us/ocean-token) rewards and [Oasis ROSE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network) rewards.

### OCEAN Rewards

- A special “DF buyer” bot purchases Predictoor feeds. It started operating on Nov 9, 2023. Every day, it spends 1/7 of the weekly Predictoor OCEAN budget for another 24h subscription. It spends an equal amount per feed. (Currently there are  feeds: 10 x 5min, 10 x 1h.)
- The OCEAN comes from the Ocean DF budget, and specifically, the Active DF budget.

### ROSE Rewards

- Payout happens on Mondays, 4 days after the end of the DF round. 
- ⚠️ To be counted for ROSE rewards of a given DF round, you must claim your OCEAN rewards for that DF round. See  [Predictoor DF user guide](predictoordf-guide.md).
- Payout for a given predictoor is pro-rata to the net earnings of that predictoor over that DF round, specifically (total sales $ to the predictoor) minus (predictoor stake slashed due to being wrong).
- The ROSE comes from a generous contribution of[ Oasis Protocol Foundation](https://oasisprotocol.org/) 👪🙏.


## How to Earn $ Via Predictoor DF

**Running a predictoor bot will automatically make you eligible for Predictoor DF rewards.**

The [Predictoor DF user guide](predictoordf-guide.md) tells how to get started as a predictoor, and how to claim rewards.

## How to Earn More $ Via Passive DF & Volume DF

Predictoor DF makes [Active DF](../data-farming/volumedf.md) more attractive, and in turn [Passive DF](../data-farming/passivedf.md). You should be familiar with both before reading on.

**Predictoor DF makes Volume DF more attractive than status quo**, because the volume-based bounds on weekly rewards trends tend to be markedly higher for prediction feeds. (The Appendix has details.)

**Curating is straightforward.** Ocean assets with high DCV are easy to identify: it's the 20 OPF-published prediction feeds. This makes the choice of veOCEAN allocation easy: point to those 20 assets.

**Doing Volume DF gives Passive DF rewards too**, of course.

The net result: Predictoor DF means earnings potential from Predictoor DF, Volume DF, and Passive DF.

## Appendix: On DCV Bounds of Prediction Feeds

**Predictoor DF makes Volume DF more attractive than status quo.** Active DF's rewards are bounded by `DCV_bound` which in turn is bound by sales volume and fees. In Predictoor DF, both those factors are raised; this raises the bounds in Volume DF; this in turn means higher earning potential. Let's elaborate.

At one time, Volume DF had a "wash consume" problem, where people published and consumed their own datasets. [DF9](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1) onwards address this, by putting a bounds on weekly rewards:

> `DCV_bound = DCV * m`

Where `m` = `DCV_bounding_multiplier` = `Ocean community fee (0.1%) + publish market fee`

This stopped wash consume 💪 because it became unprofitable to _do_ wash consume: fees eat up all potential profits.

A low `DCV` (data consume volume) or a low `m` (publish market fee) mean low `DCV_bound`.

Predictoor DF makes both `DCV` and `m` higher!

- **`DCV` is higher:** the 37K OCEAN/week counts as consume volume
- **`m` is higher:** publish market fee is 20% for prediction feeds

Therefore `DCV_bound` is higher. Specifically: `DCV_bound = 37500 * (0.001 + 0.20) = 7537.5 OCEAN`. In other words, at least 7537.5 OCEAN is available for Volume DF in any given week.

## Notes

The BTC/USDT 5m and 1h feeds follow the same Volume DF mechanics as the other feeds, despite being free on the webapp.

Details: the BTC feeds _are_ priced at the smart contract level. The webapp receives datatokens for those feeds and makes the prediction values public. Because the BTC feeds _are_ priced, then: their DCV is non-negligible; allocating veOCEAN to them makes sense; and Volume DF rewards accrue to them as well.
