In Volume DF, you allocate veOCEAN to data assets with high data consume volume (DCV). You do this via the DF dApp.

We'll show you how!  

#### Step 1 - Navigate to the DF dApp

- Go to [https://df.oceandao.org](https://df.oceandao.org)

#### Step 2 - Connect your wallet

- Connect your wallet to the dApp, on Ethereum mainnet

#### Step 3 - Click the Volume DF tab in the top menu

#### Step 4 - Select the assets which you would like to allocate to by toggling the percentage allocation at the end of the row

- On the rightmost column, toggle the percentage of your total Allocation Power that you wish to allocate to each asset of your choice. You will **get a portion of the sales** of each asset that you allocate to!
- Note that if you allocate to an asset that YOU published, then you will get an **effective 2x allocation boost**.
- If you are a publisher and curating your own asset, your asset may be styled differently in the UI.

#### Step 5 - Click the Update Allocations button

- Click the pink Update Allocations button
- Sign the transactions with your wallet & pay the gas fees

That's it! You've successfully allocated (aka "voted on") your favorite assets in the Ocean ecosystem using your veOCEAN and are generating active rewards yield. Now, just wait until next Thursday to see if you can [claim any OCEAN rewards](claim-rewards.md) on the Active Rewards section of the [Rewards page](https://df.oceandao.org/rewards) for your portion of the assets' sales. Remember that your first time claiming rewards will require at least one week, but not more than 2 weeks of wait!
