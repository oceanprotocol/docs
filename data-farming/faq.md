# FAQ

## Staking and Risk

<details>

<summary>What does "staking" mean in an Ocean context?</summary>

Its precise meaning depends on the DF stream.

* Predictoor DF: put OCEAN into a prediction transaction

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are there any risks associated with DF?</summary>

As with any system, inherent risks exist. We try to minimize them, as follows.

* Predictoor DF: you stake a small amount of OCEAN in each epoch (eg every 5min). If issues arise, you can get out quickly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there any impermanent loss (IL) in my staking?</summary>

No. IL is typically associated with providing liquidity to decentralized exchange or pools. There are no pools involved in any of the DF streams \[1].

</details>

## Rewards Payout

<details>

<summary>What APYs can I expect?</summary>

For Predictoor DF, it varies a lot based on your prediction accuracy, and more.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can the DF rewards change during a given week?</summary>

No. At the beginning of a new DF round, rules are laid out, either implicitly if no change from the previous round, or explicitly in a blog post if there are new rules.

Caveat: itâ€™s "no" at least in theory! Sometimes there may be tweaks if there is community consensus or a bug.
