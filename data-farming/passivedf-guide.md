In order to **get yield in DF**, you will need to lock your OCEAN first! When you lock your OCEAN, you get **veOCEAN** and **weekly passive OCEAN rewards** in return. veOCEAN is a token used in Ocean Protocol's Data Farming dApp to **generate even more yield,** called **Volume DF rewards**, for allocating your veOCEAN to your favorite assets and get a portion of their sales!

### Don't have OCEAN yet? Get those first!

#### Step 1 - Get OCEAN

- Acquire OCEAN via a decentralized exchange (DEX) such as Uniswap or a centralized exchange (CEX) such as Binance, Coinbase, etc.

#### Step 2 - Send to your self-custody wallet

- Send your OCEAN to a self-custody wallet of yours that supports ERC-20 tokens, like Metamask for example.

In this step you will:

- Enter the amount of OCEAN that you are going to lock up

- Click the pink ‚ÄúApprove # OCEAN‚Äù button
- Accept the transaction in your wallet.
- Click the ‚ÄúCreate Lock‚Äù button.
- Accept the transaction in your wallet.

Congratulations! You have now locked your OCEAN for veOCEAN and are generating passive yield automatically. You can [claim your passive OCEAN rewards](claim-rewards.md) every Thursday - note that your first time claiming rewards will require at least one week, but not more than 2 weeks of wait!
