# Ocean Uploader

### What is Ocean Uploader? 

Uploader is designed to simplify the process of storring your assets on decentralized networks (such as [arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) and [filecoin](https://filecoin.io/)). It provides access to multiple secure, reliable, and cost-effective storage solutions in an easy to use UI and javascript library.

### What decentralized storage options are available?

Currently we support Arweave and we will soon be releasing Filecoin support. In the future we will also support multiple other options.
