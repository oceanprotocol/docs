# Ocean Uploader

### What is Ocean Uploader? 

Uploader is designed to simplify the process of storing your assets on decentralized networks (such as [arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) and [filecoin](https://filecoin.io/)). It provides access to multiple secure, reliable, and cost-effective storage solutions in an easy-to-use UI and JavaScript library.

### What decentralized storage options are available?

Currently, we support Arweave and  IPFS. We may support other storage options in the future.
