# Ocean Uploader

### What is Ocean Uploader? 

Uploader is designed to simplify the process of storring your assets on decentralized networks (such as [arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) and [filecoin](https://filecoin.io/)). It provides access to multiple secure, reliable, and cost-effective storage solutions in an easy to use UI and javascript library.

### What decentralized storage options are available?

Currently we support Arweave and we will soon be releasing Filecoin support. In the future we will also support multiple other options. 

### How to store an asset on Arweave with the Uploader UI?

Woohoo ðŸŽ‰ You did it! You now have an Arweave transaction ID for your asset. Pop on over to arweave.net/{YOUR_TXID} to admire your handiwork, you'll be able to access your file at that link. You can use that link to now go and publish your asset on [Ocean Market](../../developers/uploader/uploader-ui-marketplace.md).
