# Logging in to the Marketplace

For a user to publish or consume assets, they have to log in to the marketplace. Logging in to the marketplace requires connecting to the marketplace server with both the MetaMask web3 wallet and the SSI wallet.

## &#x20;Precondition

The user has gone through the onboarding process, at the end of which they have the following:

* The Metamask web3 wallet is configured with a valid web3 address.
* The SSI wallet account is set up and populated with DIDs and Verifiable Credentials.
* Optional: The user has enough native tokens in their wallet to pay the gas for blockchain transactions.
* Optional: The user has added funds to their web3 address for the token(s) used in the marketplace to purchase assets.&#x20;

## Steps

To log in to the marketplace, perform the following steps:

1\. On the main page, press the Connect Wallet button.

**Note:** the SSI Wallet URL is cached in the browser, so future logins to the marketplace won't require entering the SSI Wallet URL. If the user wants to update the SSI Wallet URL,  it can be done from Settings -> Update SSI Walet API, as shown below.
