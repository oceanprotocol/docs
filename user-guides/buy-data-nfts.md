# Buy NFT Data

Before we go shopping, it's important to note that the primary responsibility for data validation rests with the customer. To evaluate the quality of the data, take into account the following questions:

1. What is the reputation of the dataset's publisher?
2. Does the dataset include well-defined metadata and provenance information?
3. Is sample data available for evaluation?
4. What is the dataset's rating within the marketplace? (Check the star rating we've implemented.)
5. Is the publisher responsive to inquiries? You can initiate a direct message to the publisher via the marketplace to engage in discussions before making a data purchase.

Once you're confident that the dataset meets your requirements, you're ready to make your purchase! 🛒📊

### Let's Go Shopping! 💁‍♀️🛍️

1. Go to the [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/).
2. Search for NFTs using the search bar in the top right corner of the page. The Ocean Marketplace provides features to search for Data/Algorithm NFTs by text, and users can also sort the result by published date.
3. Connect your wallet. If you know the network the asset is hosted on, then you can also select the network from the dropdown to the left of the Connect Wallet button to filter!
