# Manage Your OCEAN

If you don't see any OCEAN in your crypto wallet software ðŸ”Ž (e.g. MetaMask or MyEtherWallet), don't worry! It might not know how to manage OCEAN yet.

For an ERC-20 wallet to see OCEAN, the wallet typically needs to have OCEAN's address added as a custom token.
- The [Networks docs](../discover/networks/README.md) give the address of OCEAN on each network, and how to get OCEAN on each of those networks.
- Then, use that information for the wallet instructions below.


### MetaMask

1. Make sure MetaMask is connected to the Ethereum Mainnet.
2. Select the account you want to manage.
3. Scroll down until the `Import Tokens` link is visible, then click on it.
4. Click on `Custom Tokens`.
5. Paste the OCEAN contract address listed above into the _Token Contract Address_ field. The other two fields should auto-fill. If not, add `OCEAN` for the symbol and `18` for the precision.
6. Click `Add custom token`.
7. Click `Import Tokens`.

If you prefer visual demonstrations, we have prepared a visual demo that illustrates the steps mentioned above.

MetaMask should now show your OCEAN balance, and when you're looking at that, there should be a `Send` button to send OCEAN to others. For help with that, see [the MetaMask docs about how to send tokens](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488931-How-to-Send-Tokens).

### Other Wallet Software

Do a web search to find out how to add a custom ERC-20 token to the wallet software you're using.
