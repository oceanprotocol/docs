# Manage Your OCEAN

If you don't see any OCEAN in your crypto wallet software 🔎 (e.g. MetaMask or MyEtherWallet), don't worry! It might not know how to manage OCEAN yet.

For an ERC-20 wallet to see OCEAN, the wallet typically needs to have OCEAN's address added as a custom token.
- The [OCEAN docs page](../discover/ocean-token.md) has the OCEAN address for each network.
- Then, use that information for the wallet instructions below.


### MetaMask

1. Make sure MetaMask is connected to the Ethereum Mainnet.
2. Select the account you want to manage.
3. Scroll down until the `Import Tokens` link is visible, then click on it.
4. Click on `Custom Tokens`.
5. Paste the OCEAN contract address listed above into the _Token Contract Address_ field. The other two fields should auto-fill. If not, add `OCEAN` for the symbol and `18` for the precision.
6. Click `Add custom token`.
7. Click `Import Tokens`.

If you prefer visual demonstrations, we have prepared a visual demo that illustrates the steps mentioned above.

MetaMask should now show your OCEAN balance, and when you're looking at that, there should be a `Send` button to send OCEAN to others. For help with that, see [the MetaMask docs about how to send tokens](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488931-How-to-Send-Tokens).

### Other Wallet Software

Do a web search to find out how to add a custom ERC-20 token to the wallet software you're using.
