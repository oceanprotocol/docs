# Basic concepts - to be updated

You'll need to know a thing or two about blockchains to understand Ocean Protocol's tech... Let's get started with the basics 🧑‍🏫

## Blockchain: The backbone of Ocean

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that enables the decentralized nature of Ocean. At its core, blockchain is a **distributed ledger** that securely **records and verifies transactions across a network of computers**. It operates on the following key concepts that ensure trust and immutability:

* **Decentralization**: Blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries by enabling a peer-to-peer network where transactions are validated collectively. This decentralized structure reduces reliance on centralized authorities, enhances transparency, and promotes a more inclusive data economy.
* **Immutability**: Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it becomes virtually impossible to alter or tamper with. The data is stored in blocks, which are cryptographically linked together, forming an unchangeable chain of information. Immutability ensures the integrity and reliability of data, providing a foundation of trust in the Ocean ecosystem. Furthermore, it enables reliable traceability of historical transactions.
* **Consensus Mechanisms**: Blockchain networks employ consensus mechanisms to validate and agree upon the state of the ledger. These mechanisms ensure that all participants validate transactions without relying on a central authority, crucially maintaining a reliable view of the blockchain's history. The consensus mechanisms make it difficult for malicious actors to manipulate the blockchain's history or conduct fraudulent transactions. Popular consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Ocean harnesses the power of blockchain to facilitate secure and auditable data exchange. This ensures that data transactions are transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof. Here's how Ocean uses blockchains:

* **Data Asset Representation**: Data assets in Ocean are represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain. NFTs provide a unique identifier for each data asset, allowing for seamless tracking, ownership verification, and access control. Through NFTs and datatokens, data assets become easily tradable and interoperable within the Ocean ecosystem.
* **Smart Contracts**: Ocean uses smart contracts to automate and enforce the terms of data exchange. Smart contracts act as self-executing agreements that facilitate the transfer of data assets between parties based on predefined conditions - they are the exact mechanisms of decentralization. This enables cyber-secure data transactions and eliminates the need for intermediaries.
* **Tamper-Proof Audit Trail**: Every data transaction on Ocean is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and tamper-proof audit trail. This ensures the transparency and traceability of data usage, providing data scientists with a verifiable record of the data transaction history. Data scientists can query addresses of data transfers on-chain to understand data usage.

By integrating blockchain technology, Ocean establishes a trusted infrastructure for data exchange. It empowers individuals and organizations to securely share, monetize, and leverage data assets while maintaining control and privacy.
