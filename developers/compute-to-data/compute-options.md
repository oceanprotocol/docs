## Compute Options


An asset with a service of `type` `compute` has the following additional attributes under the `compute` object. This object is required if the asset is of `type` `compute`, but can be omitted for `type` of `access`.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **`allowRawAlgorithm`*** | `boolean` | If `true`, any passed raw text will be allowed to run. Useful for an algorithm drag & drop use case, but increases risk of data escape through malicious user input. Should be `false` by default in all implementations. |
| **`allowNetworkAccess`*** | `boolean` | If `true`, the algorithm job will have network access. |
| **`publisherTrustedAlgorithmPublishers`*** | Array of `string` | If not defined, then any published algorithm is allowed. If empty array, then no algorithm is allowed. If not empty any algo published by the defined publishers is allowed.                                              |
| **`publisherTrustedAlgorithms`***          | Array of `publisherTrustedAlgorithms` | If not defined, then any published algorithm is allowed. If empty array, then no algorithm is allowed. Otherwise only the algorithms defined in the array are allowed. (see below).                                       |

\* Required

## Trusted Algorithms

The `publisherTrustedAlgorithms` is an array of objects with the following structure:

| Attribute                      | Type     | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`did`**                      | `string` | The DID of the algorithm which is trusted by the publisher. |
| **`filesChecksum`**            | `string` | Hash of algorithm's files (as `string`).                    |
| **`containerSectionChecksum`** | `string` | Hash of algorithm's image details (as `string`).            |

To produce `filesChecksum`, call the Provider FileInfoEndpoint with parameter withChecksum = True. If algorithm has multiple files, `filesChecksum` is a concatenated string of all files checksums (ie: checksumFile1+checksumFile2 , etc)

To produce `containerSectionChecksum`:

```js
sha256(algorithm_ddo.metadata.algorithm.container.entrypoint + algorithm_ddo.metadata.algorithm.container.checksum);
```

          },
          {

            "containerSectionChecksum": "210"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Consumer Parameters

Sometimes, the asset needs additional input data before downloading or running a Compute-to-Data job. Examples:

* The publisher needs to know the sampling interval before the buyer downloads it. Suppose the dataset URL is `https://example.com/mydata`. The publisher defines a field called `sampling` and asks the buyer to enter a value. This parameter is then added to the URL of the published dataset as query parameters: `https://example.com/mydata?sampling=10`.
* An algorithm that needs to know the number of iterations it should perform. In this case, the algorithm publisher defines a field called `iterations`. The buyer needs to enter a value for the `iterations` parameter. Later, this value is stored in a specific location in the Compute-to-Data pod for the algorithm to read and use it.

The `consumerParameters` is an array of objects. Each object defines a field and has the following structure:

| Attribute         | Type                             | Description                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`name`***        | `string`                         | The parameter name (this is sent as HTTP param or key towards algo)        |
| **`type`***        | `string`                         | The field type (text, number, boolean, select)                             |
| **`label`***       | `string`                         | The field label which is displayed                                         |
| **`required`***    | `boolean`                        | If customer input for this field is mandatory.                             |
| **`description`*** | `string`                         | The field description.                                                     |
| **`default`***     | `string`, `number`, or `boolean` | The field default value. For select types, `string` key of default option. |
| **`options`**     | Array of `option`                 | For select types, a list of options.                                       |

\* Required

Each `option` is an `object` containing a single key:value pair where the key is the option name, and the value is the option value.

Algorithms will have access to a JSON file located at `/data/inputs/algoCustomData.json`, which contains the `keys/values` for input data required. Example:
