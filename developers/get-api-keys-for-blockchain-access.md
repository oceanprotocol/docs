# Get API Keys for Blockchain Access

This article points out an alternative for configuring remote networks on Ocean Protocol components: the libraries, Provider, Aquarius, Subgraph, without using Barge services.

### Get API key for Ethereum node provider

Ocean Protocol's smart contracts are deployed on EVM-compatible networks. Using an API key provided by a third-party Ethereum node provider allows you to interact with the Ocean Protocol's smart contracts on the supported networks without requiring you to host a local node.

Choose any API provider of your choice. Some of the commonly used are:

* [Infura](https://infura.io/)
* [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
* [Moralis](https://moralis.io/)

The supported networks are listed [here](contracts/networks.md).

Let's configure the remote setup for the mentioned components in the following sections.
