With Ocean, crypto wallets transform into magical data wallets, where your data can roam freely and securely. Crypto exchanges? Well, they've taken on a new role as data marketplaces, where you can showcase and trade your valuable data treasures. And hold on tight because DAOs are here to create epic data co-ops, where collaboration and innovation reign supreme! ü§ù

But hold on tight, because we have even more in store for you! With Ocean Protocol, you gain access to a treasure trove of tools that will unlock your data scientist superpowers and allow you to unleash your creativity. Whether you're a Python aficionado or a JavaScript maestro, we have you covered with [ocean.py](ocean.py/README.md) and [ocean.js](ocean.js/README.md) libraries. So, get ready to dive into the depths of data innovation and create the next groundbreaking dAapp (that's a decentralized App, by the way) using [ocean.js's](ocean.js/README.md) powerful capabilities or unleash your skills with [ocean.py](ocean.py/README.md). It's time to shake up the data world like never before! üåêüöÄ

At the core of the Ocean Protocol, you'll find a constellation of [smart contracts](contracts/README.md) that bring extraordinary capabilities to every data asset. Here's where the magic happens! Every asset gets its own cool and unique [**ERC721 data NFT**](contracts/data-nfts.md#what-is-a-data-nft), along with one (or more) [**ERC20 datatokens**](contracts/datanft-and-datatoken.md). It's like giving your data its very own superhero cape! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

These [smart contracts](contracts/README.md) form the backbone of Ocean Protocol, empowering data assets with unparalleled value and enabling seamless integration with the wider blockchain ecosystem. Through the [contracts](contracts/README.md), data becomes not only valuable but also tradable, allowing you to unleash the true potential of your data treasures.

Now, if you're new to the world of web3 and blockchain technologies, fear not! We've got you covered. Before diving into the depths of Ocean Protocol, we recommend starting with some introductory guides. These [guides](../user-guides/README.md) will gently introduce you to the magical world of [web3](../discover/wallets/README.md) and help you understand the [basics](../discover/wallets-and-ocean.md) before you embark on your epic data-driven adventure.
