# Ocean Protocol VSCode Extension

The Ocean Protocol VSCode extension brings Ocean Protocol's powerful data sharing and monetization capabilities directly into your development environment. Whether you're publishing datasets, running compute-to-data jobs, or managing Ocean Protocol assets, you can do it all without leaving Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started

The extension adds a dedicated Ocean Protocol section to your VSCode workspace. You'll find it in the activity bar on the left side of your VSCode window, marked with the Ocean Protocol logo.

### First-time Setup

When you first open the extension, you'll need to configure a few settings:

1. RPC URL - This is your connection to the blockchain
2. Ocean Node URL - Where your Ocean node is running
3. Private Key - For signing transactions (keep this secure!)

{% hint style="info" %}
Your private key is stored securely within VSCode and is never transmitted to external services.
{% endhint %}

## Key Features

### Publishing Data Assets

Turn your data into a monetizable asset on Ocean Protocol with just a few clicks.

1. Select "Publish Asset" from the Ocean Protocol panel
2. Choose your metadata file (JSON format)
3. Click "Publish Asset"

The extension handles all the complex interactions with Ocean Protocol, including:
- Creating the necessary NFTs and datatokens
- Encrypting your data URLs
- Setting up access control
- Publishing metadata to the network

{% hint style="success" %}
You can track the publication progress directly in VSCode's output panel.
{% endhint %}

### Asset Discovery and Management

Easily explore and manage Ocean Protocol assets:

- Search for assets using their DID
- View detailed asset information
- See pricing and access details
- Monitor asset status

### Compute-to-Data Operations

Run privacy-preserving computations on data without exposing the raw data:

1. Choose your dataset
2. Select your algorithm
3. Configure compute settings
4. Start your compute job

Track your compute jobs in real-time:
- View job status and progress
- Access computation logs
- Download results when complete

### P2P Network Interaction

Monitor and interact with Ocean Protocol's P2P network directly from VSCode:

- View your node's ID
- See connected peers
- Monitor network health
- Track node status

### Asset Downloads

Download Ocean Protocol assets straight to your workspace:

1. Enter the asset's DID
2. Choose your download location
3. Click to download

The extension handles:
- Authentication
- Payment processing
- Decryption
- File downloads

## Best Practices

### Asset Publishing

1. **Metadata Preparation**
   - Include comprehensive descriptions
   - Set appropriate tags
   - Define clear access terms

2. **Access Control**
   - Use appropriate pricing models
   - Set reasonable timeout values
   - Consider your target users

### Compute-to-Data

1. **Algorithm Design**
   - Test locally first
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor compute usage
   - Set appropriate time limits
   - Consider data scale

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting:
1. Verify your RPC URL
2. Check your node status
3. Confirm network connectivity

### Publishing Problems

If asset publishing fails:
1. Validate your metadata format
2. Check your wallet balance
3. Verify your permissions

### Compute Job Issues

For compute job problems:
1. Verify algorithm compatibility
2. Check resource availability
3. Monitor compute logs
