# Intro 🎬

🔍🤔 Calling all data wizards! Are you a curious data scientist 🧙‍♀️ who's heard whispers about Web3 and blockchain, but don't know where to dive in? Have you invented a mind-blowing AI algorithm and want to turn it into 💰 gold? Maybe you're training an LLM (Lusciously Lucrative Model) and want to specify the terms for your data's licensing 📜. Or hey, you just want to sell your data without giving up your privacy 🕵️‍♂️ or control 🚫🙅‍♂️.

Guess what? 🎉 Say hello to ocean.py! It's like a magical Python library 🐍 that lets you secretly 🤫 and securely 🔒 publish, swap, and gobble up data. 🐙💦 It works wonders by teaming up with Ocean Protocol 🌊 to give you all those incredible benefits mentioned above. So get ready to dive into the data ocean with a splash! 💦🌊



## ocean.py Strengths 💪

ocean.py lets you do the following things:

- Publish data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. 
Create an ERC721 data NFT for each service, and ERC20 datatoken for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
- Sell datatokens via for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
- Transfer data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions using web3.py or Brownie.

And here is an outline video which describes the concepts better.

## ocean.py Quickstart 🚀
To kickstart your adventure with ocean.py, we set out the following steps to get you zooming ahead in no time!

1. Install Ocean 📥
2. Setup 🛠️
— Remote (Win, MacOS, Linux)
— or Local (Linux only)
3. Walk through main flow 🚶‍♂️: publish asset, post for free / for sale, dispense it / buy it, and consume it

After these quickstart steps, the main [README](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/README.md) points to several other use cases, such as [Predict-ETH](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth), [Data Farming](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/df.md),
on-chain key-value stores ([public](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/key-value-public.md) or [private](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/key-value-private.md)), and other types of data assets ([REST API](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-restapi.md),
[GraphQL](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-graphql.md), [on-chain](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-onchain.md)).
