# Install

Let’s start interacting with the python library by firstly installing it.

ocean.py is a Python library on pypi as ocean-lib. So as you might expect, you can install it with:

```console
pip install ocean-lib
```

⚠️ Make sure that you use the above command in a virtual environment.

Oh, buoy! 🌊🐙 When it comes to installation, ocean.py has you covered with a special README called ["install.md"](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/install.md). It's like a trusty guide that helps you navigate all the nitty-gritty details. So, let's dive in and ride the waves of installation together! 🏄‍♂️🌊
