# Ocean.py

Ocean.py is built for the key environment of data scientists: Python. It's a library that can simply be imported alongside other Python data science tools like numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn and tensorflow.

**[[Quickstart at ocean.py README]](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/README.md)**

With ocean.py, you can:

* **Publish** data services: data feeds, REST APIs, downloadable files or compute-to-data. Create an ERC721 **data NFT** for each service, and ERC20 **datatoken** for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
* **Sell** datatokens via for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
* **Transfer** data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions using web3.

Ocean.py READMEs have with all the info to install Ocean, set it up for local or remote networks, and use it for everything from sharing AI models to Compute-to-Data. [Get started here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/README.md).
