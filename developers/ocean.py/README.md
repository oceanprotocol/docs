# Ocean.py



Attention all data enthusiasts! Are you an inquisitive data scientist intrigued by the world of Web3 and blockchain, but unsure of where to begin? Have you developed a groundbreaking AI algorithm and desire to transform it into profitable success? Perhaps you're engaged in training a highly lucrative model (LLM) and seek to define precise licensing terms for your valuable data. Or maybe you simply wish to sell your data while maintaining utmost privacy and control.

This is where ocean.py can help. It is a Python library for data scientists to privately & securely publish, exchange, and consume data. üêôüí¶

### Overview

ocean.py lets you do the following things:

* Publish data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. Create an ERC721 data NFT for each service, and ERC20 datatoken for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
* Sell datatokens via for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
* Transfer data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions using web3.

### Quickstart üöÄ

To kickstart your adventure with ocean.py, we set out the following steps to get you zooming ahead in no time!

1. [Install Ocean](install.md) üì•
2. Setup üõ†Ô∏è ‚Äî [Remote ](remote-setup.md)(Win, MacOS, Linux) ‚Äî or [Local ](local-setup.md)(Linux only)
3. [Publish asset](publish-flow.md), post for free / for sale, dispense it / buy it, and [consume ](consume-flow.md)it
4. Run algorithms through [Compute-to-Data flow](compute-flow.md) using Ocean environment.

After these quickstart steps, the main [README](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/README.md) points to several other use cases, such as [Data Farming - Challenge DF](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth), [Data Farming - Volume DF](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/df.md), on-chain key-value stores ([public](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/key-value-public.md) or [private](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/key-value-private.md)), and other types of data assets ([REST API](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-restapi.md), [GraphQL](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-graphql.md), [on-chain](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-onchain.md)).
