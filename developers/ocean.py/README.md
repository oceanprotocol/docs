### Overview

ocean.py serves as a connection layer bridging the V4 smart contracts and various components such as Provider, Aquarius, and Compute to Data engine within Ocean Protocol. This pythonic library brings all these elements together, facilitating seamless integration and interaction. By acting as an intermediary, ocean.py enables developers to easily leverage the functionalities offered by Ocean Protocol, making it a valuable tool in building applications and solutions that utilize decentralized data marketplaces. Its purpose is to simplify the process of connecting with smart contracts and accessing services provided by Provider, Aquarius, and Compute to Data engine, providing a convenient and efficient development experience for users.

### ocean.py Strengths 💪

ocean.py lets you do the following things:

* Publish data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. Create an ERC721 data NFT for each service, and ERC20 datatoken for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
* Sell datatokens via for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
* Transfer data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions using  Brownie.

### ocean.py Quickstart 🚀

To kickstart your adventure with ocean.py, we set out the following steps to get you zooming ahead in no time!

1. Install Ocean 📥
2. Setup 🛠️ — Remote (Win, MacOS, Linux) — or Local (Linux only)
3. Walk through main flow 🚶‍♂️: publish asset, post for free / for sale, dispense it / buy it, and consume it

After these quickstart steps, the main [README](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/README.md) points to several other use cases, such as [Predict-ETH](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth), [Data Farming](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/df.md), on-chain key-value stores ([public](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/key-value-public.md) or [private](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/key-value-private.md)), and other types of data assets ([REST API](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-restapi.md), [GraphQL](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-graphql.md), [on-chain](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/publish-flow-onchain.md)).
