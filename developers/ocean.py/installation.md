# Installation 📥


Let’s start interacting with the python library  by firstly installing it.

ocean.py is a Python library on pypi as ocean-lib. So as you might expect, you can install it with:

```console
pip install ocean-lib
```

⚠️ Make sure that you use the above command in a virtual environment.


Oh, buoy! 🌊🐙 When it comes to installation,
ocean.py has you covered with a special README called ["install.md"](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/install.md).
It's like a trusty guide that helps you navigate all the nitty-gritty details. So, let's dive in and ride the waves of installation together! 🏄‍♂️🌊
