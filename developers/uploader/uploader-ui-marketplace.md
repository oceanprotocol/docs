This feature not only simplifies the process of storing and managing files but also seamlessly integrates with the Ocean Marketplace. Once your file is uploaded via Uploader UI, you can conveniently use the generated hash or CID to interact with your assets on the Ocean Marketplace, streamlining the process of sharing, validating, and trading your digital content.
