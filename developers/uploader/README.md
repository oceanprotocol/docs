# Uploader

### What's Uploader?

The Uploader represents a cutting-edge solution designed to streamline the upload process within a decentralized network. Built with efficiency and scalability in mind, Uploader leverages advanced technologies to provide secure, reliable, and cost-effective storage solutions to users.

### Architecture Overview

Uploader is built on a robust architecture that seamlessly integrates various components to ensure optimal performance. The architecture consists of:

- Uploader API Layer: Exposes both public and private APIs for frontend and microservices interactions, respectively.
- 1-N Storage Microservices: Multiple microservices, each specializing in different storage types, responsible for handling storage operations.
- IPFS Integration: Temporary storage using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

### Streamlined File Uploads

Uploader streamlines the file uploading process, providing users with a seamless experience to effortlessly incorporate their digital assets into a decentralized network. Whether you're uploading images, documents, or other media, Uploader enhances accessibility and ease of use, fostering a more decentralized and inclusive digital landscape.

### Unique Identifiers

Obtain unique identifiers such as hashes or CIDs for your uploaded files. These unique identifiers play a pivotal role in enabling efficient tracking and interaction with decentralized assets. By obtaining these identifiers, users gain a crucial toolset for managing, verifying, and engaging with their digital assets on the decentralized network, ensuring a robust and secure mechanism for overseeing the lifecycle of their contributed files.

### Features

Uploader offers a range of powerful features tailored to meet the needs of any decentralized storage:

- User Content Uploads: Users can seamlessly upload their content through the user-friendly frontend interface.
- Payment Handling: Uploader integrates with payment systems to manage the financial aspects of storage services.
- Decentralized Storage: Content is pushed to decentralized storage networks like Filecoin and Arweave for enhanced security and redundancy.
- API Documentation: Comprehensive API documentation on each repo to allow users to understand and interact with the system effortlessly.
- Uploader.js: a TypeScript library designed to simplify interaction with the Uploader API. This library provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for calling API endpoints within the Uploader Storage system.

### User Workflow

Uploader simplifies the user workflow, allowing for easy management of storage operations:

- Users fetch available storage types and payment options from the frontend.
- Quotes for storing files on the Microservice network.
- Files are uploaded from the frontend to Uploader, which handles temporary storage via IPFS.
- The Microservice takes over, ensuring data is stored on the selected network securely.
- Users can monitor upload status and retrieve links to access their stored content.
